THIS PROJECT WILL ONLY RUN IN TL-ENGINE. A GAMING ENGINE DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL LANCASHIRE.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
This was my second project exploring coding using the TL-ENGINE libary.

EDIT: looking back on this after a year of progression is humbling to say the least. The scale of the project was ambitious and my coding style was clearly that of a novice.
However, no less valuable because in the end it worked, and that is something to be proud of.

I may revise the code at a later date and compare the new version to the old. This will help me quantify my progression.
